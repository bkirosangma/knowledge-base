# Knowledge Base

Unified skill for managing knowledge-base vaults — structured collections of documents and diagrams on any topic. Each vault stores its content, cross-references, and metadata under a `.archdesigner/` config directory.

## Usage

```
/knowledge-base init [path]              — Initialize a new vault at path (default: cwd)
/knowledge-base diagram <topic>          — Generate a diagram on <topic>
/knowledge-base document <topic> [-i]    — Generate a standalone document on <topic>
/knowledge-base create <topic> [-i]      — Generate both a document and diagram, linked together
/knowledge-base validate <path> [--fix]  — Validate (and optionally auto-fix) a diagram JSON file
```

Options:
- `-i`, `--interactive` — Enter interactive mode: ask clarifying questions before generating content (available for `document` and `create`)
- `--fix` — After validation, write the corrected JSON back to disk (a timestamped backup of the original is kept). Without this flag `validate` is read-only. (Available for `validate`.)

Examples:
```
/knowledge-base init ~/vaults/distributed-systems
/knowledge-base diagram "Kubernetes pod lifecycle"
/knowledge-base document "Event sourcing patterns" -i
/knowledge-base create "Microservices authentication flow"
/kb create "GraphQL federation architecture" -i
/knowledge-base validate ./auth-flow.json
/kb validate ./broken-diagram.json --fix
```

## Sub-Command Routing

Parse the user's argument string to determine the sub-command, then dispatch to the corresponding command file.

### Parsing Rules

1. Split the argument string on whitespace. The first token is the sub-command candidate.
2. Everything after the sub-command token is the **remaining args** (topic, path, flags).
3. Check for the `-i` or `--interactive` flag anywhere in remaining args — if present, strip it and set `interactive = true`.

### Dispatch Table

| First token         | Action                                                                                             |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *(empty)* or `help` | Print the Usage block above with short descriptions of each sub-command. Do not read any file.     |
| `init`              | Read `~/.claude/skills/knowledge-base/commands/init.md` and execute it. Pass remaining args as **path** (default to cwd if empty). |
| `diagram`           | Read `~/.claude/skills/knowledge-base/commands/diagram.md` and execute it. Pass remaining args as **topic**. |
| `document`          | Read `~/.claude/skills/knowledge-base/commands/document.md` and execute it. Pass remaining args as **topic**. Pass `interactive` flag. |
| `create`            | Read `~/.claude/skills/knowledge-base/commands/create.md` and execute it. Pass remaining args as **topic**. Pass `interactive` flag. |
| `validate`          | Read `~/.claude/skills/knowledge-base/commands/validate.md` and execute it. Pass remaining args as **path** (a file or glob). Pass a `fix` flag when `--fix` appears in the args (strip the flag before passing the path). |
| *anything else*     | Treat the **entire** argument string (including the unrecognized token) as the **topic**. Route to `create` — this is the most common use case. Read `~/.claude/skills/knowledge-base/commands/create.md`. |

When reading a command file, follow every instruction inside it. The command file is the authority on how to execute that sub-command.

## Vault Detection

Before dispatching any sub-command, determine whether we are inside a vault.

### Detection Algorithm

1. Start at the current working directory.
2. Check if `.archdesigner/config.json` exists in this directory.
3. If not found, move one level up. Repeat up to **3 parent levels** (4 directories total including cwd).
4. If found:
   - That directory is the **vault root**.
   - Read `.archdesigner/config.json` to get `vaultName` and other vault settings.
   - Pass vault root path and config to the sub-command.
5. If not found after checking all levels:
   - Warn the user: "No vault detected in the current directory tree. Vault-specific features (cross-referencing, topic registry, backlinks) will not be available. Run `/knowledge-base init` to set up a vault."
   - Still proceed with the sub-command — documents and diagrams can be generated without a vault, they just won't be registered.

### Exception

The `init` sub-command does NOT require an existing vault (it creates one). Skip the "not found" warning for `init`.

## Compound Intelligence

Before executing any sub-command (after vault detection, before reading the command file), gather context from all available intelligence systems. This context is passed to the sub-command so it can produce higher-quality, non-redundant output.

### 1. graphify (Structural)

If a vault is detected and `graphify-out/` exists inside the vault root:
- Query the vault's knowledge graph for content related to the topic: `/graphify query "<topic>"`
- Read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` for god nodes and community structure relevant to the topic.
- Collect: related existing documents, diagrams, cross-references, and structural clusters.

### 2. claude-mem (Temporal)

Search past session work for anything related to the topic:
- Use MCP tool `mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__search` with `query: "<topic>"`.
- Collect: past decisions, architectural patterns, prior diagrams on similar topics, lessons learned.

### 3. MEMORY.md (Curated)

If a vault is detected, check for `<vault-root>/.archdesigner/MEMORY.md`:
- Read it for user preferences, topic registry entries, style feedback, and conventions.
- Also check `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md` for project-level preferences.

### Context Assembly

Combine gathered context into a structured block that the sub-command can reference:

```
## Gathered Context

### Existing Related Content
- [list of related docs/diagrams found via graphify]

### Past Session Work
- [relevant observations from claude-mem]

### User Preferences
- [preferences and conventions from MEMORY.md]
```

If a particular intelligence system yields no results, omit its section rather than including an empty one. If no vault is detected, only claude-mem context will be available.
